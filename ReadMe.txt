#  DisasterShield — Wildfire Incident Forecasting & Risk Analysis

##  Project Overview
This project analyzes 20 years of Amazon rainforest wildfire data to predict future fire patterns and help with emergency response planning.

##  What This Project Does
-  Analyzes fire trends from 1998-2017
-  Builds machine learning models to predict fires
-  Identifies high-risk areas and seasons
-  Creates beautiful visualizations

##  Quick Start
1. Download the `wildfire_forecasting.ipynb` file
2. Open it in Jupyter Notebook
3. Run all cells to see the magic!

## Files in This Project
- `wildfire_forecasting.ipynb` - Main analysis notebook
- `requirements.txt` - Python packages needed
- `.gitignore` - Files to ignore

##  Key Findings
- Fire incidents are increasing over time
- Certain states have higher fire risks  
- Seasonal patterns clearly visible
- Machine learning can successfully predict fire trends

##  Why This Matters
This project helps:
-  Fire departments plan better
-  Protect the Amazon rainforest
-  Governments make data-driven decisions

##  About the Creator
Made with ❤️ by Rivu Biswas as a data Analysis and Data Science project to combat wildfires.
